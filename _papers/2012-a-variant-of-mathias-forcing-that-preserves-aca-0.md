We present and analyze $$F_\sigma$$-Mathias forcing, which is similar but tamer than Mathias forcing. In particular, we show that this forcing preserves certain weak subsystems of second-order arithmetic such as $$\mathsf{ACA}_0$$ and $$\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \mathsf{I}\Sigma^0_2$$, whereas Mathias forcing does not. We also show that the needed reals for $$F_\sigma$$-Mathias forcing (in the sense of Blass) are just the computable reals, as opposed to the hyperarithmetic reals for Mathias forcing.
