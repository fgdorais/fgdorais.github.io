This paper analyzes theorems about algebraic field extensions using the techniques of reverse mathematics. In section 2, we show that $$\mathsf{WKL}_0$$ is equivalent to the ability to extend $$F$$-automorphisms of field extensions to automorphisms of $$\bar{F}$$, the algebraic closure of $$F$$. Section 3 explores finitary conditions for embeddability. Normal and Galois extensions are discussed in section 4, and the Galois correspondence theorems for infinite field extensions are treated in section 5.
