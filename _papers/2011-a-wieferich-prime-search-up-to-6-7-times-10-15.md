A _Wieferich prime_ is a prime $$p$$ such that $$2^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$$. Despite several intensive searches, only two Wieferich primes are known: $$p = 1093$$ and $$p = 3511$$. This paper describes a new search algorithm for Wieferich primes using double-precision Montgomery arithmetic and a memoryless sieve, which runs significantly faster than previously published algorithms, allowing us to report that there are no other Wieferich primes $$p < 6.7 \times 10^{15}$$. Furthermore, our method allowed for the efficent collection of statistical data on Fermat quotients, leading to a strong empirical confirmation of a conjecture of Crandall, Dilcher, and Pomerance. Our methods proved flexible enough to search for new solutions of $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2}$$ for other small values of $$a$$, and to extend the search for Fibonacci-Wieferich primes. We conclude, among other things, that there are no Fibonacci-Wieferich primes $$p < 9.7 \times 10^{14}$$.
