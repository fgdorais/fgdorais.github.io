We prove that the statement "there is a $$k$$ such that for every $$f$$ there is a $$k$$-bounded diagonally non-recursive function relative to 4$f$$" does not imply weak KÃ¶nig lemma over $$\mathrm{RCA}_0 + \mathrm{B}\Sigma^0_2$$. This answers a question posed by Simpson. A recursion-theoretic consequence is that the classic fact that every $$k$$-bounded diagonally non-recursive function computes a $$2$$-bounded diagonally non-recursive function may fail in the absence of $$\mathrm{I}\Sigma^0_2$$.
