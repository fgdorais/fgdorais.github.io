We study the reverse mathematics of pigeonhole principles for finite powers of the ordinal $$\omega$$. Four natural formulations are presented and their relative strengths are compared. In the analysis of the pigeonhole principle for $$\omega^2$$, we uncover two weak variants of Ramsey's Theorem for pairs.
