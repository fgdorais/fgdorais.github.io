We introduce new properties of Hamel bases. We show that it is consistent with ZFC that such Hamel bases exist. Under the assumption that there exists a Hamel basis with one of these properties we construct a discontinuous and additive function that is Marczewski measurable. Moreover, we show that such a function can additionally have the intermediate value property (and even be an extendable function). Finally, we examine sums and limits of such functions.
