Using almost-invariant sets, we show that a family of Marczewski-Burstin algebras over groups are not closed under algebraic sums. We also give an application of almost-invariant sets to the difference property in the sense of de Bruijn. In particular, we show that if $$G$$ is a perfect Abelian Polish group then there exists a Marczewski null set $$A \subseteq G$$ such that $$A+A$$ is not Marczewski measurable, and we show that the family of Marczewski measurable real valued functions defined on $$G$$ does not have the difference property.
