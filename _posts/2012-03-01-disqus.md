I have just enabled [Disqus](http://disqus.com/about/) commenting system. It has lots of nice features, but there are a few bugs we need to fix â€” that's part of the [Boole's Rings](http://boolesrings.org/) way... 

<del>The most obvious issue is that [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) currently doesn't work in comments. I'm hoping that will get fixed very soon, so keep on using $$\LaTeX$$ in comments even if it's not pretty for the moment.</del>

There are a few other minor issues. Let me know if you encounter an issue, that will help us tune this new plugin.
