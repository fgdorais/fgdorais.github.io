Arguably one of the best [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/) comics ever... 

![XKCD - 982 - Set Theory](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/set_theory.png)

The alternate text for this comic is a modern lumberjack's proof of Zermelo's Theorem. 

> Proof of Zermelo's well-ordering theorem given the Axiom of Choice: 1: Take S to be any set. 2: When I reach step three, if S hasn't managed to find a well-ordering relation for itself, I'll feed it into this wood chipper. 3: Hey, look, S is well-ordered.
