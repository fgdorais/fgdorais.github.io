Roughly three years ago, I wrote [Back to the origin]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-06-30-back-to-the-origin %}), when I came back to Hanover, New Hampshire. I've now moved to Burlington, Vermont, which is roughly half way between Hanover and Montréal, Québec, which is my true origin. I'm very happy to start a new position at the [University of Vermont](http://uvm.edu)!
