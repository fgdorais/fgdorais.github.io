I am now settling into my new place in Hanover, New Hampshire. I am starting my new position as a [John Wesley Young](http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1932-38-09/S0002-9904-1932-05469-6/home.html) Research Instructor at [Dartmouth College](http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/) on July 1. It's great to be back where it all started!
