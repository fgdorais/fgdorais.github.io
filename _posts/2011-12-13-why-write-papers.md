Here is what Dror Bar-Natan had to [say about that](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/83092/what-is-the-main-goal-of-a-paper-really/83093#83093) on MathOverflow: 

> Papers are written so that their author(s) can forget their content and move on to other things. Therefore when you write you should be very careful to put in enough of the big picture and enough of the details so you'd be able to reconstruct your thoughts 10 years later if you'll need to, assuming you'll forget everything but retain some familiarity with some basic principles of mathematics.

It's nice to think that papers could be so useful in light of the [recent publishing debate](http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/2011/11/26/the-recent-publishing-debate-a-timeline/)...
