I just made my [first contribution](https://plus.google.com/110930549217362212976/posts/UfFUcHpHQEi) to the [Selected Papers Network](https://selectedpapers.net/). It was fun and easy and I strongly recommend you use it too! 

It's too early for serious commentary on the experience but there are a few things I noted right away: 

  * The front page [selectedpapers.net](https://selectedpapers.net/) does not yet support [MathJax](). (Neither does Google+ but that's another problem.) Hopefully that will be fixed soon. Meanwhile, you can use the [MathJax bookmarklet](http://checkmyworking.com/misc/mathjax-bookmarklet/).
  * The [hashtag syntax](http://docs.selectedpapers.net/hashtags.html) is fairly simple and intuitive but there is room for improvement. The main improvement would be to relax the ID rules to allow full urls which are easier to cut and paste. For example, `http://arxiv.org/abs/1234.6789` for `arXiv:1234.6789`, `http://dx.doi.org/10.1234/0987654321` for `doi:10.1234/0987654321`.
  * Comments do not seem to generate [arXiv trackbacks](http://arxiv.org/help/trackback/). (Or they have not yet made it through the arXiv editorial process.)
  * I wish [topic (hash)tags](http://docs.selectedpapers.net/hashtags.html) were allowed to have natural syntax. I can't think of a good reason why this has to follow the Twitter standard. Should it be `#cstarAlgebras` or `#CstarAlgebras` or `#CStarAlgebras`... why not `C*-algebras`? It's better to allow natural syntax and implement a tag synonym system.
You can track these and other issues here.
