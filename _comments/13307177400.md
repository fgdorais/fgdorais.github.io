There is an example in "The Atomic Model Theorem and Type Omitting" by Hirschfeldt, Shore, and Slaman. They showed that the two principles $$\Pi^0_1-G$$ and AMT are not equivalent over $$\mathsf{RCA}_0$$ but they are equivalent over $$\mathsf{RCA}_0$$ plus $$\Sigma^0_2$$ induction. This is described in their paper in the prose below Corollary 4.5.
