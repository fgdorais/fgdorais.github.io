Can you explain in what sense the linearly ordered universes "restrict" the global structure of universes more than your preferred version? Either one would require adding some additional rules in order to get larger universes, and I don't see anything about the linearly ordered universes that makes it any harder to add such additional rules. 

It's also worth noting that if what want wants is consistency strength corresponding to large cardinal axioms, one can obtain this without modifying the structure of the "universe" hierarchy by instead adding constructions that increase the "size" of the existing universes. For instance, if a particular universe is closed under inductive-recursive definitions of a suitable sort, then it automatically has a Mahlo-like property, without changing any of the rules that apply specifically to that universe. That's one of the reasons I don't have any problem with a fixed linearly ordered sequence of universes.
