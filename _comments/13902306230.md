Interesting. So your point is that I cannot "bundle together" the universe structure $$(\mathcal{U}, \tau, \pi, \sigma, \ldots)$$ unless $$\tau$$ lands somewhere. Let me try to explain for my own benefit and that of others: in type theory it is perfectly ok to have a primitive judgment "is a type" in which case something like $$\tau$$ can just be a type family, i.e., its validity is established as the judgment "in the context $$a : \mathcal{U}$$ the term $$\tau(a)$$ is a type". However, as soon as I want to make a _structure_ $$(\mathcal{U}, \tau, \pi, \sigma, \ldots)$$ then the structure must have a type, and then asking "what is the type of the second component?" forces $$\tau$$ to have a codomain. 

There are type theories which distinguish between types and kinds. The distinction is akin to that of sets and classes. Would it make sense to do it that way so that $$\mathcal{U}$$ would be a kind?
