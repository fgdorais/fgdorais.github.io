You're right but the point I'm trying to make is that there is a right balance for doing things informally, which is actually in between forgetting everything (the fully extensional way) and remembering everything (the fully intensional way). 

If I work the fully intensional way, then I need to do something with the paths all the time. If I think of elements of $$R^\times$$ as triples $$(x,y,p)$$ then the group product is 
^
$$(x_0,y_0,p_0)\cdot(x_1,y_1,p_1) := (x_0 \cdot x_1,y_1 \cdot y_0,\text{messy path}),$$
^
 and I am compelled to write it that way (perhaps relying on my proof assistant to write the messy path for me). That's an unnecessary burden since the path is always uniquely determined and almost never used. 

If I work the fully extensional way, then I need to recall all the necessary data all the time. That's also an unnecessary burden. We're all used to it but anyone who spent time teaching intro to proofs at the college level knows how hard it is to communicate the idea of "using definitions"... 

The middle ground I used seems just right to me: all the data I need is right there and the data I don't need to worry about is out of sight. Note that I still remember the extra data is there, I just choose to ignore it since I know _in advance_ that I don't need to worry about it.
