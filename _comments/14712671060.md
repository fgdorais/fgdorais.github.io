Thanks for the link. Just one question: what is $$k$$, the exponent of $$-\frac{1}{2}$$ in the second clause of the definition of the Cauchy sequence (in the linked SEP entry)? I suppose it is to be the smallest $$k$$ among those numbers which falsify the Goldbach's conjecture and thus the sequence stabilizes on some fixed rational number $$(-\frac{1}{2})^n$$. Otherwise it makes little sense to me, as $$k$$ is bounded by the existential quantifier.
