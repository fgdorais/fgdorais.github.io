The discussion in the comments here between Mike Shulman, Todd Trimble and I are very interesting. I just posted an [answer on MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/116701/how-would-set-theory-research-be-affected-by-using-etcs-instead-of-zfc/118009#118009) summarizing my point of view in this discussion. Thank you very much Mike and Todd for the very engaging, stimulating, and entertaining discussion!
