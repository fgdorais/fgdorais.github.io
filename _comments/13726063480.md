I think a simple example that requires $$U_\omega$$ is the following: assuming the axiom of choice, the V in §10.5 is a model of ZFC, but if you consider the V in $$U_\omega$$ you even get a model of ZFC + there exists $$\omega$$ inaccessible cardinals. And I don’t see how to get such a model without $$U_\omega$$ (and without induction-recursion).
