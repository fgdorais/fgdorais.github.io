Edit: I redacted a claim that the second result follows from the first using arguments similar to those Jared Corduan and I used in _[On the indecomposability of $$\omega^n$$_](http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1367). That unfortunate claim was at best incomplete and possibly false. Since the claim was only tangential to the topic, early redaction was the best course of action.
