An axiom is a true sentence, so preservation is a non-issue (between models of that axiom, of course). Preservation is more interesting for formulas with free variables, such as "$$R$$ is a wellfounded relation on $$X$$," in which case a morphism preserves it if it maps objects that satisfy the formula in one structure to objects that satisfy the formula in the other structure.
