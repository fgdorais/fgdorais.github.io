I still don't see it. The reason why it's important to have that is that wellfoundedness is then absolute: it transfers between transitive models. That's a structural idea, right? The point is to choose the theory that makes important things fit well. Since wellfoundedness is a key idea in set theory, it should fit well. 

To me this is a lot like choosing the right morphisms for the category of Banach spaces. If I think that isomorphic spaces should have the same norm, I'll choose contraction maps; if I think that they should just have equivalent norms, I'll choose continuous maps. Both are fine, it's just a question of choosing the right one for the task.
