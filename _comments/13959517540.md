I don't quite understand what you mean, but my best guess is that you're suggesting something like Francois says that Andrej suggested: define a universe to be a type of ("codes for") types together with operations exhibiting how all the type-forming operations act on those codes. The problem with that is, as Francois said and I expanded on above, it won't behave judgmentally the way we want universes to behave.
