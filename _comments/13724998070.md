It’s also not far to attribute those paradoxes to Cantor. Cantor knew that some multiplicities were inconsistent (in modern terminology, that some classes are large), and his set theory had no antinomies. The worst that one could say is that Cantor’s set theory was too imprecise to have the paradoxes. It was Frege’s attempt to make Cantor’s set theory more precise in a too naive way that introduced the paradoxes.
