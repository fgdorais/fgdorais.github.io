Although the intended readers of my papers are other mathematicians, not myself, I agree with the advice to put in enough information so that the paper will make sense to me 10 years from now. It's embarrassing to write "clearly," "obviously," etc., and later be unable to remember why these things were clear, obvious, etc. I hope that, by making things clear to my future self, who won't remember my present network of ideas, I also make things clear to my present readers who (I expect) have not yet explored that network.
