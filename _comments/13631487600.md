I really like your post. What an interesting perspective! I enjoyed your imagery of "trunks" of the multiverse through a finite divine lens. Regarding your compatibility theorem, if two universes are compatible, then are they both $$V_{\alpha}$$'s for different $$\alpha$$'s? To answer the final question in your post, I prefer the multiverse perspective since it helps me understand forcing, and is so enriching philosophically. I find the debate fascinating, and look forward to more discussion among mathematicians.
