Thanks Assaf! The third question is the one that started all of this. I'm mostly thinking about it under PFA, but anything will do. Trees won't work because they are 2-dimensional (lex-order in two opposite ways) but I really like the idea of using a Cohen real as a diagonalization tool. A $$\Diamond$$ argument also sounds likely though that probably won't help understanding the PFA situation.
