I don't think it's _dangerous_ to conflate Level and Nat, at least not in the sense of inconsistency. It just yields a different type theory than the one we used in the book. 

Do you have a proof of strong collection for V using large universes? I would be intrigued to see it. 

Of course, the "resizing axioms" are intended to single out exactly those types that are "small" or "innocuous" enough to stay in the same universe...
