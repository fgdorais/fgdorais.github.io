So you can prove weak soundness and weak completeness (which you had better be able to do, since these are classical results), and these combine into weak equivalence (automatically, since we are dealing with mere propositions). Also, you can prove strong soundness, but strong equivalence (as you have stated) is probably not true. 

Do you suspect that strong completeness is also false as you have stated it? Or do you think that strong completeness is also true, but the two directions are not quasi-inverses?
