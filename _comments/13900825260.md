_Update_: A "natural" example of a non-uniform proof (via "universe hopping") can be found in [this later post](http://dorais.org/archives/1532). It illustrates a failure of the $$\omega$$-rule, where there is an arithmetical statement $$\phi(n)$$ such that one can prove $$\phi(0), \phi(1),\ldots$$ but there is no proof of $$\forall n:\mathbb{N}\,\phi(n).$$ The problem is that there is no uniform term $$p(n)$$ such that $$p(n):\phi(n)$$ so the $$\Pi$$-intro (or generalization rule) does not apply. 

However, and this is the point, the argument for $$\forall n:\mathbb{N}\,\phi(n)$$ is perfectly reasonable since the $$\omega$$-rule is _intuitively_ valid. It is therefore unacceptable for a foundation to explicitly exclude this argument. HoTT needs to be able to accommodate this type of argument via additional large universe hypotheses. 

Note that the post linked above also shows that conflating the universe indices with the internal natural numbers $$\mathbb{N}$$ does indeed raise the consistency strength of HoTT with AC and hence LEM.
