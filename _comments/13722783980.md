I have a side question about universes. Would it be useful for something to have very large universes (like $$U_\omega$$, $$U_{\omega+1}$$, $$U_{\epsilon_0}$$ and so on)? I think that in set theory there are some arithmetic statements that can only be proved using very large cardinals, is the same thing true in type theory ?
