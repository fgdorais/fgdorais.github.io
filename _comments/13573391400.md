Both. ETCS is more awkward because the tools available to handle wellfoundedness are clumsy: there is no canonical skeleton like transitive sets and computing limits and colimits requires work. Working in ETCS also more difficult because there is no simple check to make sure that wellfoundedness is preserved. Even going through the interpretation of pure sets doesn't help since there is no simple characterization of pure sets in ETCS.
