Actually, since I also had to explain my _a priori_ reason for dropping the path component, there may be more merit to using $$(x,y) \in R^\times$$ than I thought. It is a more explicit way of forgetting the path coordinate without contaminating the intensional theory with bits of extensionality. 

I'm still not feeling great about this. The $$\in$$ relation is just a kludge to eliminate the set builder notation -- $$x \in \set{x : A \mid P(x)}$$ is defined as $$P(x)$$ -- and the set builder notation is already something I was trying to avoid. More importantly, there is also the temptation to use it to forget things that are actually useful...
