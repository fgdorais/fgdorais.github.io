Yes, that is correct. Thanks for reformulating the issue, I think it's good for readers to see multiple perspectives. Issues that are at a purely formal level like this one are difficult to explain. 

I like your idea of kinds; it sounds like an attractive alternative to a bare-bones super universe, if only on a purely philosophical level. As I remarked at the end, Super HoTT isn't particularly attractive for the ontology of HoTT since the super universe is basically a kludge whose existence is difficult to motivate. It seems that type theory with kinds wouldn't suffer as much from this even if it turns out to be equivalent for all practical purposes. Do you have a reference so I can see how kinds are handled formally?
