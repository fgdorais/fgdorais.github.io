I just stumbled across this posting of yours. We have never met I think. You might know me as the author of THE BANACH-TARSKI PARDOX (1985, and now 2016). I grew up in Montreal and went to grad school at Dartmouth, so I understand very well the geography of what you are talking about! 

But I ended up at Smith College, and then Macalester College, and am now retired in Colorado (at 10,000 feet elev).
