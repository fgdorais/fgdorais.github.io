Also, I would not want to encourage anyone to think of "uniformity" of the construction as a "hypothesis". It's a hypothesis in the meta-theory, a premise of the judgment rule for introducing terms in Pi-types (although even then it's not that there is some property of something called "uniformity" that has to be verified), but it's not a _mathematical_ hypothesis of the sort that we generally assume and verify. Avoiding confusion on this point is especially important when we talk about equality, because judgmental equality, being a judgment, is not something that can freely be "assumed" and "proven" in the same way that propositional equality can.
