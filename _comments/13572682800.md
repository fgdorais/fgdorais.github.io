The problem is with extensions of models. You can expand a model of ETCS with new sets and morphisms (even while preserving nnos) in such a way that there is some wellfounded relation in the original model which is not wellfounded in the extension. There is no way to prevent that other than just requiring that the extension preserves wellorderings. 

ETCS is not the only theory with this problem. Second order arithmetic has this problem too. There, three different categories with the same objects coexist: simple embeddings, $$\omega$$-embeddings that preserve the natural numbers, and $$\beta$$-embeddings that preserve the natural numbers and $$\Pi^1_1$$ statements (equivalently, wellfoundedness). It is possible to study wellfoundedness in ETCS, it's just more awkward since it similarly requires distinguishing simple embeddings from those that preserve $$\Pi_1$$ statements. For ZFC, the distinction between simple embeddings and transitive embeddings is very simple, natural, and elegant!
