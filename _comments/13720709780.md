Hm. Actually, I don't think we disagree: the passage from entailment to implication is the deduction theorem and I wanted to illustrate what lies behind it in HoTT (since it's a bit different than in classical first-order logic). 

Uniformity is very clear in the $$\Pi$$-introduction rule: you need _one_ expression $$\Phi:B(x)$$ to get $$\lambda x.\Phi:\prod B(x)$$. That's all I'm saying by "the final path was obtained uniformly."
