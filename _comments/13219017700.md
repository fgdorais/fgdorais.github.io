This is explained later on in the post. The forward implication is $$S \in S \lthen (S \in S \lthen \text{Santa exists})$$ which gives $$S \in S \lthen \text{Santa exists}$$ by contraction. 

Of course, this is an invalid proof in linear logic, which does not admit the contraction rule, but then I would have to be more precise about what implication means...
