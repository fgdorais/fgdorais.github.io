In order to have a counterexample, you need to be in a non-classical setting. The counterexample will depend on that setting. In classical settings, every set is decidable. In constructive settings, $$\mathbb{R}$$ is an example of a set which is not decidable (see [Brouwer's counterexamples](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brouwer/weakcounterex.html)). 

The argument above gives a counterexample assuming the existence of some statement $$\phi$$ such that $$\phi \lor \lnot\phi$$ is not true. In that case, the set $$\set{p,\set{0}}$$ is not decidable since $$p = \set{0}$$ is equivalent to $$\phi$$. Of course, and this is the main point of my post, this example uses extensionality.
