When I caught up on last week's Booles' Rings activity, I read this and wanted to write something -- but couldn't quite formulate, why I like this post. I didn't want to just leave a spammish "Great post!" comment and just now realized what's so great about your post: it's a perfect example for the range of content I hoped for when Sam and I started to think about this project. 

Thank you, Fran√ßois!
