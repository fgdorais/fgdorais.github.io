I chose to write the proof it this way to illustrate what lies behind the generalization rule and the deduction theorem in HoTT. I agree that the wrap-up at the end of the proof doesn't need spelling out, but I don't think it would be right to stop where the classical proof would end since that would stop shy of the goal: an element of type $$\mathsf{lrid}$$. (Note that this can be fixed by starting the proof a little differently.) 

Regarding uniformity, it depends what you mean by "obtain" but non-uniform proofs definitely happen if you assume some LEM. I think they can also happen in plain HoTT by fooling around with universes in silly ways.
