You are correct. That Brouwer counterexample is the alternating sequence $$a(n) = (-1/2)^n$$ unless a counterexample to Goldbach (or an occurrence of $$358$$ consecutive $$7$$'s in the digits of $$\pi$$, etc.) has been found before $$n$$, in which case $$a(n) = (-1/2)^k$$ where $$k \leq n$$ is that first counterexample.
