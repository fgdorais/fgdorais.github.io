Peter, it seems there are some missing parts in your second paragraph. I'm assuming you don't mean Michael's textbook on quantum computing. What are these models you're talking about? I don't see any sense in which Shelah, Wiles, Grothendiek, and Perelman would constitute realistic models for run-of-the-mill mathematicians.
