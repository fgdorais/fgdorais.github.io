Absolutely! Specifying the length of the hierarchy is not necessarily the right way to approach that at first. (It leads very fine grained analysis which makes little sense without the bigger picture.) More interesting (and more natural) are reflection principles which state that cofinally many universes "behave" just like the real universe for various notions of "behave". Since the real universe, with everything in it, doesn't exist as an actual type this is the only way to internalize global statements. 

None of this has been studied with respect to HoTT but we already have a child poster for testing: determinacy principles. These are statements are about rather small types ($$\mathbb{N}$$, $$\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$$, $$(\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N}$$) but we already know from their set-theoretic analyses that many cannot be proven without the use of large universes.
