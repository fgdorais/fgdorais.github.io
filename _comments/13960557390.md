I have just discoved your post "HoTT should eat itself". I was thinking at exactly the problem you describe in the post. After reading your article I realize that it is not as easy as I was feeling. And I miss knowledge in model theory to really understand most of the discussion... 

However Following your words: "Thatâ€™s just what we need: more people with more different backgrounds and perspectives working on the problem.", I will keep going my own way and see if it can lead to anything valuable... Thanks for your always clear answers.
