I don't think the Russell paradox needs the law of the excluded middle. Once you've derived (as you said) a contradiction from $$R \in R$$ and another contradiction from $$R \notin R$$, the first proves (even intuitionistically) that $$R \notin R$$ (thanks to the intuitionistic meaning of negation as implying a contradiction), and then the second gives you an outright contradiction.
