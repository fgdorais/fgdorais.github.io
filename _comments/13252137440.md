No, there wasn't anything missing. It was just poor writing on my part. 

I meant "Reinventing discovery", Michael Nielsen's book about how the web will change the way research is done. I just finished part 1, hoping to post a review at some point. It's an interesting read so far, partially well known to me (e.g. polymath), partially surprising, partially confusing. 

What I meant with "Shelah's model" is the idea of massive collaboration, spreading and helping as much as possible. With "Wiles's model" I meant the idea of hiding preliminary results for years so that nobody can scoop. We need a different attitude towards making influences transparent (and the tools to give credit) so that we can find ways to modularize research much further.
