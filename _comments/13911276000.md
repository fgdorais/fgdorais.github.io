Yes, this is much closer to what I believe universes in HoTT ought to be. Thanks for the pointer, I will need to look into this... 

It would be great if universe formation could fit into some kind of generalization of higher inductive types. This possibility also puts an interesting spin on the ongoing discussion on the formal rules for higher inductive types in HoTT. Such an approach would also be ontologically much more satisfying than ad hoc approaches such as Super HoTT.
