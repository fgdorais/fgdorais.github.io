OK. It looks like the main part of this is (unintentional) ambiguity. Cofinality is still an issue: When we say that A is a type, we mean that it inhabits some universe $$\mathcal{U}_i$$. (Section 1.3.) I still like my two axioms better. Every type belongs to some universe by (1) and by (2) every universe starts an unbounded chain. The only loss is that $$\mathcal{U}_i$$ doesn't mean anything specific. (I can't believe that would be useful for anything significant.) 

It also resolves the (not so important) philosophical issue of the indices. The two axioms give you a chain of 17 universes whenever you need that many. However, the two axioms don't give you an actual "infinite chain" in any definite sense. (As I mentioned earlier, an infinite chain of universes indexed by the internal $$\mathbb{N}$$ would be "too weird," to borrow [Jesse's expression](/archives/1438#13720379460).)
