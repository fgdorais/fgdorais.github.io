We started with Google+, and next we'll probably do Twitter, and perhaps some blogs. The point of using existing social networks is that they already put some work into making sure users have verified identities. We don't want the system to be flooded with anonymous comments, since that tends to lead to flame wars and other problems. If we get enough programmers and other people on board, we could do things that require more work. But the first step is to get a growing number of users.
