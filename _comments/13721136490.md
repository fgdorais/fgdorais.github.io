Yep. I don't think we disagree. 

We probably draw the formalization line at different places. It's a fuzzy line anyway... 

But does that make a proof using such a large universe wrong? (Just a heads up, in case you hadn't noticed: further in that direction are the HoTT analogue of "large cardinals" in ZFC...)
