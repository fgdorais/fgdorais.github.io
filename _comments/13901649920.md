Subgroups and quotients are special cases of group homomorphisms. 

Unlike in set theory, elements of a type don't have a life outside of that type, so you can't pick out the elements you like to form a subset. If you want to form a subtype $$\set{ a : A \mid \phi(a)}$$ you can use a dependent pair type $$\sum_{a:A} \phi(a)$$ whose elements are pairs $$(a,p)$$ where $$a:A$$ and $$p:\phi(a)$$. Then the first coordinate projection gives an embedding $$\sum_{a:A} \phi(A) \to A$$ whose "image" is the right "subtype" of $$A$$. 

The _existence_ of quotient groups is a little more delicate but they are all there. I plan to get there in a later post. In the mean time, you can check out the [HoTT book](http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) and read about higher inductive types in chapter 6.
