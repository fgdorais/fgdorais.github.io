Interesting. Let me just mention that people studied "large cardinals" in the contect of type theory. Since ordinals do not play nice constructively, they get replaced by inductive constructions, or rather closure properties under inductive definitions. For instance, a type universe is a type which is closed under dependent sums and products. I think people came up with principles that correspond to Mahlo cardinals (see the work of Anton Setzer), but no further. 

You suggested that we simply index universes by ordinals, which probably works in classical HoTT. Without classical logic it is going to get a bit trickier, I suspect. It would be interesting to see if we can formulate inductive constructions or some other device that gets us to measurables.
