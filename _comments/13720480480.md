Trying to put it another way. This really isn't a proof, so salt it to taste; but it would be weird to have a term that means a proof of $$ e = e $$ in all $$H$$-spaces that wasn't homotopic to reflectivity because, on the one hand, there is only that equation in the discrete case, and on the other hand it really can't be decidable whether a generic higher inductive type presents a discrete type or not; so whatever term would have to fail to be homotopic because it should also fail to be really computable. 

(I had earlier thought that it'd be even weirder because for various reasons, I'd convinced myself that the nonstandard identification $$e=e$$ would have to live in the center of $$\Omega_e G$$; but actually for $$H$$-spaces, that's not weird at all, which is a fun exercise.)
