How would you do it for someone using an inaccessible in ZFC? I don't see any difference. 

If you can suggest a _specific, well-defined_ type theory we could use as the foundation for the book that can nevertheless be "agnostic" about how strong of universes there are, I would be very interested. We had to pick something!!
