Well, you're still saying "prohibits" when I would find it more accurate to say "does not allow", but I see the point. 

For reference, I'd like "HoTT v1.0" to refer to the type theory used throughout the book, which is not completely formalized in the appendix. In particular, it includes all the (higher) inductive types used in the book. Admittedly, the class of allowable HITs is not precisely defined, which means that "HoTT v1.0" is not fully precisely specified, but I think it is more useful to use the phrase this way.
