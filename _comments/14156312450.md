That's very nice. My guess is that each of three addition, multiplication and exponentiation cannot be recovered from the other two. 

That been said, assuming the axiom of choice it's at least easy to get addition from multiplication and vice versa, for infinite cardinals it's easy, for finite cardinals (which can be singled out with either addition or multiplication), addition obviously defines multiplication by induction and multiplication defines the successor ($$p+1$$ is the unique number such that for all $$q$$, there is no multiple of $$q$$ strictly between $$qp$$ and $$q(p+1)$$) and by induction we get addition. 

Of course the above is much more than an existential formula. And the axiom of choice. My guess, in other words, is that without the axiom of choice, given any formula using just two operations on cardinals, we can find a model of ZF where the formula doesn't define the third.
