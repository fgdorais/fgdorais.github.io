It's still necessary to address the main point. If the truncated proof were submitted by a student, I would deduct a few points for not mentioning the relationship with an actual element of type $$\mathsf{lrid}$$. Of course, there are plenty of ways around that that don't involve spelling out the $$\lambda$$-terms. 

I agree that everything you can say inside _formal_ type theory is uniform, but this not true in an informal setting. Verifying the hypotheses is a pretty standard mathematical practice. It's often not necessary since the hypotheses are often clearly visible but, especially in combination with uses of generalization and the deduction theorem, it's sometimes necessary to remind the reader why the hypotheses are valid. Not doing this can easily lead to mistakes! I'm sure good examples of this will pop up here pretty soon; this is not a good one since it's painfully obvious that the hypothesis of $$\Pi$$-intro was satisfied.
