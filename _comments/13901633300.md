A separate judgment for universe is not entirely necessary. Your approach is similar to the "super-universe" approach. The issue is your type family $$\tau$$, which has to live somewhere. If you have a super-universe, then $$\tau$$ can live there. One could say that this just pushes the problem back one layer but specifically implementing Tarski coercions just for the super universe is a nice way to work around a lot of issues. For example, the super-universe doesn't need to be univalent or have anything complex going on. One possible drawback is that in this case you do have types that don't live in some universes.
