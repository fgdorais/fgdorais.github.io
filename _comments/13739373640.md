I added a note explaining this. You're completely right about this but I still have a hard time with it. This is magnified by another problem I was dealing with: to find a good way to handle partial functions. The confounding thing is that a partial function is $$F$$ actually equal to its domain of definition $$D$$, what's even more confusing is that $$F(x)$$ is also equal to $$x \in D$$! Most of the time, I think that's pretty neat, but it also gives me some bad headaches...
