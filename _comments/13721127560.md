If it had been a 10 page proof, then I would agree. Your argument above is just very short, so I didn't see the need. Perhaps there is no real disagreement there. 

Adding universe levels is not "formalizing the proof". Indeed, there are a few places in the book where we add back in the universe levels when it becomes necessary, but it's still informal type theory, no proof assistants or local type theorists required. 

Nothing is wrong with your universe V of course, except that we haven't assumed such a universe in the type theory of the book. I would say that your argument _There is a universe U(0); every universe U(n) is an element of another universe U(n+1). Therefore, there is a N→U such that U(n):U(n+1) for each n_ is not valid because the "U" in "N→U" cannot be given a universe level; and also because "to be a universe" is not a proposition nor is there a "type of universes", so that there is no "operation" of going from one universe to the next.
