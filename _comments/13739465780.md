After thinking about this some more, I decided to actually write out three variants of the proof, one spelling out the paths, another using $$\in_{R \times R}$$, and a third using $$\in_R$$ (which is really just the classical proof recast in HoTT). I will insert these at the end of the post when I'm done typing them so that I can compare all three and see the pros and cons of each.
