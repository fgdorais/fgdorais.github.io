Another classic example of necessary induction in a reversal is that $$\mathsf{ACA}_0$$ is equivalent to $$\mathsf{ACA}_0'$$ in the real world and also equivalent over $$\mathsf{RCA}_0$$ plus $$\Sigma^1_1$$ induction, but not over $$\mathsf{RCA}_0$$ alone. I believe there are several other examples of this in Simpson's book, for example Theorem VII.6.9(2), although they are not emphasized as having this property.
