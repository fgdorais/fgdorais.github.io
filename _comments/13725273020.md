[Apologies Guillaume, your comment apparently got caught in my spam box for a while.] 

Interesting note about Agda. This seems to exploit the fact that some types might not belong to a universe. I find that an intriguing idea, especially from the perspective of foundations. It is, however, an interesting way to see that conflating Level and Nat can be dangerous. 

It's too early for good examples (well, it's too early for me to come up with them). I outlined the way to get something natural that requires $$\mathcal{U}_\omega$$ above but I haven't yet tried to get something concrete using that strategy. One thing that does require some large universes is to make sure that the interpretation of $$V$$ in §10.5 satisfies strong comprehension and strong collection. The problem is not specific to interpreting set theory, though, it's about quantifiers over "large" types. For example, quantifiers over $$\mathcal{U}_i$$ live in $$\mathcal{U}_{i+1}$$, so you can't use them to define types in $$\mathcal{U}_i$$ even if the desired types are, in principle, "small" or "innocuous" enough to be in $$\mathcal{U}_i$$. Large universes allow you to work around that (but never fully since that would be as good as $$\mathcal{U}:\mathcal{U}$$ which is known to be inconsistent).
