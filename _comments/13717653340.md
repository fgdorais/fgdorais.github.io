Andrej Bauer presents a slick proof of Diaconescu's theorem in this [IAS video](http://video.ias.edu/stream&ref=3195). Here is his argument... 

Let $$2 = \lbrace0,1\rbrace$$ and let $$p$$ be a proposition (which doesn't depend on $$x,y$$). Consider the sets 
^
$$\begin{aligned} A &= \lbrace x \in 2 : x = 0 \lor p \rbrace, \\\ B &= \lbrace y \in 2 : y = 1 \lor p \rbrace. \end{aligned}$$
^
 These are inhabited sets so there is a choice function $$f:\lbrace A,B \rbrace \to 2.$$ Since $$2$$ is decidable, we have $$f(A) = f(B) \lor f(A) \neq f(B).$$ In the first case, $$p$$ must hold for if $$f(A) = f(B) = 0$$ then $$0 \in B$$ and hence $$p$$ and if $$f(A) = f(B) = 1$$ then $$1 \in A$$ and hence $$p.$$ If $$f(A) \neq f(B)$$ then we must have $$A \neq B$$ and thus $$\lnot p.$$ Therefore, we conclude that $$p \lor \lnot p.$$
