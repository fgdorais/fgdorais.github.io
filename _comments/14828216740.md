And there is one more, and probably only one more like this: Issie Rabinovitch also went from Mtl (McGill) to Dartmouth. 

Where I grew up in Mtl is unusual: right downtown, at the corner of City Councillors and Sherbrooke St (1951-1960). Hard to believe there were attached single-family houses on that street!
