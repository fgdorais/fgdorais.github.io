Regarding your alternative of using the $$\in$$ relation. I'm not too fond of that. In this case, the $$\in$$ relation takes $$x \in R^\times$$ to $$\mathsf{unit}(x)$$. You need to remember how $$R^\times$$ is defined to figure out what $$\in$$ actually means. That's just a sneaky way of mapping proof-irrelevant mathematics into proof-relevant mathematics. There is no point in doing proof-relevant mathematics if it's done that way. I do see your point that one way to formalize my in-between solution is to have $$(x,y) \in R^\times$$ map to $$x\cdot y =_R \mathsf{I}$$. That's neat but there is nothing there to suggest that I had an _a priori_ reason for doing that.
