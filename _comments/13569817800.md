I understand that in two instances where category theorists have voiced discomfort or dislike of ZFC (Lawvere and Barr), that dislike really came to the fore as the result of dealing with it in the classroom, and not in research. 

If I try to introspect, I feel as if my preference for categorical approaches to logic and set theory might be partly a reflection of the type of mathematician I am generally. When I work categorically, I feel as if I'm doing pure algebra; when I attempt to read set theory as expounded by set theorists, it feels much more like combinatorics. I suspect most category theorists have this algebraizing tendency.
