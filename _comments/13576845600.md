Thanks for the comments, Andreas. I'm not sure exactly when ZFC was "crowned" but it has to be after key papers by von Neumann and Skolem in the late 1920s when the current formulation took form and before 1940 when Gödel published the details of his construction of L. (Technically, Gödel used NBG but that is morally the same as ZFC.)
