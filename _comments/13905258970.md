Normally for an "a la Tarski" universe, the coercion $$\tau$$ is required to preserve the type forming operations _judgmentally_. In other words, if $$\pi : \prod_{A : \mathcal{U}} (\tau(A) \to \mathcal{U}) \to \mathcal{U}$$ computes codes for dependent products, then we would have $$\tau(\pi(A,B)) \equiv \prod_{x:\tau(A)} \tau(B(x))$$ judgmentally. This is also not something that can be "packaged up" into a structure living inside of type theory, and I don't think introducing a super universe fixes that problem. So it seems to me that your "a la Bauer" universes can only be "weakly a la Tarski", in the sense that $$T(\pi(A,B))$$ is _equivalent_ (or propositionally equal) to $$\prod_{x:T(A)} T(B(x))$$. Weakly a-la-Tarski universes are also much easier to obtain in models (though not, as far as I know, if you also want a super universe that is strictly a-la-Tarski) but I think they are noticeably more cumbersome to use.
