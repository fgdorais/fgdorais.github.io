I don't like to see typing declarations used as if they were propositions. To some extent they are; a term may or may not have a certain type. But it's an important feature of intensional type theory that this question is decidable (and, usually, immediately so); you can see from the form of the term whether it has the claimed type or not. But when you abbreviate (_x_, _y_, _p_) as (_x_, _y_), then this is no longer decidable (which would solve the word problem for rings). 

This is where type theorists (at least those who use the colon for typing declarations) use the set membership symbol ‘∈’, with the benefit that we actually have a proposition internal to the type theory (rather than merely the external proposition that a term has a given type). Although you defined the set of units of _R_ as a subset of _R_, it can also be realised as a subset of _R_ × _R_, and that is how you are using it. In general, given any set _S_, any subset _A_ of _S_, and any element _e_ of _S_, there is a mere proposition _e_ ∈ _A_ (with a subscript _S_ on the ‘∈’ to be most proper) that indicates that _e_ belongs to _A_ (which I'm sure is defined somewhere in the HoTT book and which you can probably write down for yourself).
