No. If you drop "transitive" then you get all the same morphisms that ETCS does, so there is no loss when moving between ZFC and ETCS. What I'm saying is that if you are interested in wellfoundedness then ZFC is the right tool. The analysis of wellfoundedness is a central part (if not the central part) of set theory, so ZFC is much, much better to work in than ETCS. (For example, compare checking "$$f$$ preserves wellorderings" with checking "$$f$$ maps elements of $$x$$ onto the elements of $$f(x)$$.") 

A closer analogy with ring theory is that asking a set theorist to work in ETCS instead of ZFC is a lot like asking a ring theorist to work with addition as a ternary relation $$A(x,y,z)$$ instead of as a function $$x + y = z$$. It's simply not the right language, though you could do all the same things in principle. And, yes, the ternary relation is "more expressive" since it's much easier to think of addition as being partial and/or multivalued if it is just a ternary relation...
