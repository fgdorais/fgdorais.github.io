Indeed, there is a fair amount of prior work here. I hope that experts, like Setzer, will eventually contribute their expertise regarding large universes in HoTT. I guess the first question here is whether that existing work is compatible with univalence. The fact that ordinals/wellorderings are not nearly as well behaved without LEM is the main reason why I restricted this post to Classical HoTT but this is not an essential restriction as there are plenty of workarounds. 

Note that patterns of universes are not the only way to get large universe hypotheses. (This is also true for large cardinal hypotheses, e.g., $$0^\#$$ merely states that a particular real number exists.) It makes perfect sense to have a set with a countably additive $$\set{0,1}$$-measure defined on all of its subsets in Classical HoTT. This gives a measurable cardinal when transferred to the cumulative hierarchy. Because universes don't happen on their own, this can happen even if there is just a simple hierarchy of universes as described in the book. It's only by reinterpreting HoTT inside the set-theoretic universe with a measurable cardinal that you can get HoTT with an incredibly rich universe structure.
