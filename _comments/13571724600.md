This is the Lévy hierarchy, not the arithmetic one. In any case, this is not a syntactic issue: the point is that $$\Sigma_1$$ statements are upward absolute for transitive sets, $$\Pi_1$$ statements are downward absolute for transitive sets, so $$\Delta_1$$ statements are absolute for transitive sets.
