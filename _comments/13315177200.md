What a wonderful post. This is why I think it is so urgent that we move beyond papers -- this is exemplary research activity of the future -- quick dissemination, immediate peer review. There is no reason to actually press this into a paper, really, if credit would be given (not that Andreas needs it, but for the younger generation, this might is a much saner way to build a track record).
