Mike, since it's only been a few days, I can't say anything definite about HoTT with large universes. I'm still digesting plain HoTT. If you want an idea what large universes can do, you can look at the work of Michael Rathjen, Anton Setzer, and others on large universes in MLTT. It's too early for me to determine what effects univalence might have there but since you have much more experience with HoTT, you might be able to work through it quicker.
