It only makes sense when considering transitive substructures of a fixed wellfounded extensional structure. That is missing in ETCS so it doesn't make sense to use transitive models. 

Note that you don't need this skeleton. In ZFC, wellfoundedness is still absolute between wellfounded extensional models of (a small fragment of) ZFC, regardless of whether they are transitive models or not. Wellfoundedness is not absolute between standard models of ETCS and there does not appear to be an easy way to fix that.
