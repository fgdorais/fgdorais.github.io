Again, that's not a satisfactory answer: what's an _informal_ reason why the "proof" is wrong? How do I convince someone with such a "proof" in hand that they are doing something which is actually wrong? 

Aside: As I mentioned [before](/archives/1425#13720679120) the book's handling of universes is highly objectionable since it rules out highly plausible (and even desirable!) stronger forms instead of being agnostic about them.
