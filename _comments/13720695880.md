I don't think I agree -- I think you can end the proof exactly at the place you end the classical proof, because the unmentioned step is exactly the same as the passage from entailment to implication that is always omitted in set-theory-based informal mathematics. Can you say exactly what you mean by "starting the proof differently"? 

If you mean to refer to LEM-based proofs as non-uniform, then I _definitely_ think the phrase "since the final path was obtained uniformly‚Äù is very misleading, since we would be doing exactly the same thing to finish the proof whether or not we had used LEM in it. The only difference is that in the latter case the resulting term would depend on the hypothesis of LEM. Uniformity has nothing to do with the introduction rule for Pi-types.
