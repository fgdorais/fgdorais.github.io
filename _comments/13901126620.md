While attempting to dig up old notes on Setzer's Mahlo universes, I stumbled across a nice paper [On Universes in Type Theory](http://www2.math.uu.se/~palmgren/universe.pdf) by Erik Palmgren wherein he discusses in much greater detail a lot of the issues brought up here (though not in the specific context of HoTT since it was published in 1998).
