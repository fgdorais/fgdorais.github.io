I wouldn't downvote an answer that said that; I might even upvote if I'm in a good mood. I might make a comment if I'm in a very philosophic mood since that doesn't make justice to the second problem with the "proof": confounding the internal $$\mathbb{N}$$ and the indexing of the universes. This one is deeper. The root cause here is that the concept of induction is epistemologically prior to the internal $$\mathbb{N}$$ and its induction rule (which requires uniformity). The confusion stems from identifying both with their epistemological ancestor (which doesn't require uniformity). I don't like using the words "epistemological" on MathOverflow, so I would probably not include that much detail in my answer, but I definitely like the idea of indicating the key difference between the internal $$\mathbb{N}$$ and its ancestral concept: uniformity.
