It seems to me that you've essentially proved one direction of the theorem twice and ignored the other. You've shown that if Duplicator has a winning strategy then A and B are n-quantifier equivalent, and that if A and B are not n-quantifier equivalent then Spoiler has a winning strategy. But the theorem also claims that if Duplicator has no winning strategy (equivalently since the game is finite: if Spoiler has a winning strategy) then A and B are not n-quantifier equivalent. As far as I can see, your argument doesn't establish this. (If I remember correctly, this is the part of the proof where function symbols make life unpleasant. One has to count applications of function symbols as if they were quantifiers, to ensure that there are only finitely many inequivalent formulas of any fixed quantifier depth.)
