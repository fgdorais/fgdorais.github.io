If it were a student in an introduction-to-proofs class, then sure, I could see asking them to finish the proof by saying essentially "since we have assumed A and proven B, we can conclude that A implies B". But that would be superfluous for a student in a group theory class. I guess I wasn't sure what audience you were thinking of. 

Can you please provide an example of something you can say in informal type theory that's not uniform? I really can't think of any. Indeed, the intent with informal type theory was that *everything* be formalizable, so there should be no differences of this sort --- if there are, then that's a defect of what one means by "informal type theory" that should be remedied.
