Here are some additional observations on the other cardinal characteristics of $$\T(X)$$. 

As observed in the post, if $$X$$ is not complete then $$\operatorname{add}(\T(X)) = \aleph_0$$. For essentially the same reason, $$\operatorname{non}(\T(X)) = \aleph_0$$. Let $$(x_i)_{i<\omega}$$ be a Cauchy sequence in $$X$$ that does not converge. Then $$\set{x_0,x_1,\dots} \notin \T(X)$$, which shows that $$\operatorname{add}(\T(X)) = \non(\T(X)) = \aleph_0$$. 

The characteristic $$\operatorname{cov}(\T(X))$$ is more mysterious. If $$X$$ is open in $$\widehat{X}$$, then $$\operatorname{cov}(\T(X)) \leq \aleph_0$$. Indeed, the metric remainder $$X^*$$ is then closed, which means that $$X = \bigcup_{n<\omega} \set{x \in X : d(x,X^*) \geq 2^{-n}}$$. Beyond that, I only know the trivial upper bound $$\operatorname{cov}(\T(X)) \leq \card{X}$$.
