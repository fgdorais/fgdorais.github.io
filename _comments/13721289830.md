I don't really see what is ambiguous. I guess you're right about cofinality the way we phrased it, although I tend to prefer formalizing it with an implicit a la Tarski coercion, in which case cofinality is no longer a problem. I can see your argument, but I think the important advantages of simplicity and ease of understanding for newcomers still sways me to the choice we made in the book for purposes of exposition. 

(FWIW, An infinite chain of universes indexed by the internal N did at least at one point exist in Agda, I think; possibly now things are slightly different, but I think the type indexing universe levels is still an internal type inside the type theory.)
