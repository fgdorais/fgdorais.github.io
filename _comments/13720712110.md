Okay, I was just saying that the rest of it wouldn't be _needed_ if you didn't have the specific goal of illustration. 

It's true that you need one expression, but that sort of uniformity has nothing to do with LEM. If we used LEM then there would still be one expression, it would just involve the assumed witness of LEM. Again I think that meaning of "uniformity" is a meta-theoretic concept that doesn't need to be invoked when _doing_ mathematics -- everything we can say _inside_ the type theory is automatically uniform in the sense of being given by one expression.
