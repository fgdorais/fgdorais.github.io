There weren't any serious problems with the uses of "set theory." The suggestion was for more sensitive readers to tame things down by mentally replacing "set theory" by something less "polarized" since there were a few times where I felt uncomfortable in my reading. I didn't bother taking notes about this specifically though I did make a note that in chapter 3, "paradoxes of Cantorian set theory" should be "paradoxes of self-reference" since the issue is not inherent to set theory. I will let you know if I find anything that is particularly bad. 

As for universes, I'm not a fan of typical ambiguity but I agree that there is probably no better way to do this. My main concern is that you fix an ascending sequence of them. That makes sense for implementation but I would prefer just requiring that any two types belong to some common universe, which gives a lot more freedom how the universes are organized. This doesn't change much as far as the book's contents are concerned but I think such freedom is necessary to interpret very strong theories in extensions of HoTT.
