I like this statement. For me it also makes a very good point why we should separate scientific progress from publication. In fact, it reminds me of [Claire Mathieu's post](http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/2011/11/journals-conferences-arxiv-my-solution.html) reacting to the publishing debate spawned by Gowers: publish other people's work. It's the old "communicated by" idea taken seriously, we should never publish our own results -- or, a little softer, we should never publish alone. 

Reading Michael Nielsen's book I'm starting to think that Shelah's model is actually the future (though not as papers). We cannot afford the Wiles, the Grothendieck or the Perelman model of research.
