Yes, no problem. I'm glad your interested in thinking about this! 

Any linear order has dimension $$1$$, of course, so an infinite chain in a poset is an infinite subposet of dimension at most $$2$$. The equality relation on any set $$X$$ is a partial order of dimension $$2$$ since $${=}$$ is the intersection of any linear ordering of $$X$$ with the reverse of that linear ordering. Therefore, an infinite antichain in a poset is an infinite subposet of dimension at most $$2$$. The partition relation $$\aleph_0 \to (\aleph_0)^2_2$$ guarantees that every infinite poset either contains an infinite chain or an infinite antichain, in either case it contains an infinite suposet of dimension at most $$2$$. 

The Sierpinski coloring that witnesses $$\aleph_1 \not \to (\aleph_1)^2_2$$ comes from an uncountable $$2$$-dimensional poset. Recall that this coloring is defined as follows: pick $$\aleph_1$$ real numbers $$\langle r_\alpha \rangle_{\alpha \lt \omega_1}$$ then, for each pair $$\alpha \lt \beta \lt \omega_1$$, define $$c(\alpha,\beta) = 1$$ when $$r_\alpha \lt r_\beta$$ and $$c(\alpha,\beta) = 0$$ when $$r_\alpha \gt r_\beta$$. Thus $$c(\alpha,\beta) = 1$$ precisely when $$\alpha$$ and $$\beta$$ are comparable in the poset $$(\omega_1,{\leq_S})$$, where $${\leq_S}$$ is the intersection of the usual linear order $${\leq}$$ on $$\omega_1$$ and the linear order on $$\omega_1$$ defined by $$\alpha \leq_R \beta$$ iff $$r_\alpha \leq r_\beta$$. This is a poset of dimension $$2$$ with no uncountable chains nor uncountable antichains.
