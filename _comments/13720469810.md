i would have ended the proof at the same place that you said a classical proof would end. We wanted to prove "for all u and v, something or other", and we did it by assuming u and v and constructing the something or other. That's exactly what we had to do, by the propositions-as-types interpretation of "for all" and the introduction rule for Pi-types. Technically there is indeed a lambda-abstraction going on, but it doesn't need to be mentioned in the mathematical English, any more than classical mathematical English feels the need to mention the difference between entailment and implication. 

In particular, I think the phrase "since the final path was obtained uniformly" is misleading, because there is no _non_-uniform way to obtain anything -- is there? I wouldn't want people to think that whenever they prove a universally quantified statement in type theory they have to then check that the proof was performed "uniformly", whatever that means.
