(Mike gave me a pointer to this discussion after a post in HoTT mailing list where I was reporting my frustration with the current definition of Universes in HoTT) 

That way looks better to me than the current HoTT's infinite hierarchy of type universes. 

I'm just an amateur with fuzzy type theory knowledge, but it seems to me that an ideal solution would be to be able to define Univeral types in a similar way that we can define Universal Turing machines or Universal diophantine equations. For this you would need to have fully formalized rules for type construction - including rules for induction, and higher inductive types (and certainly also a constructive justification for the Univalent axiom). Any type being able to encode these rules would be a Universal type. 

Then it seems to me that no hiearchy of type Universe would be needed any more. The formal rules of type theory would just define what is a (single) universal type. Any other Universal type or hiearchy of Universal types could then be build within the theory. 

If this is correct, the problem with Universe is just a side effect of the current lack of complete formalization of type theory.
