Here is what I would (like to) answer if someone went on MathOverflow and asked: _Is this proof correct_? (In reference to a hypothetical inductive proof using "universe hopping" as outlined above, giving an element of type $$\prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} A(n)$$ as a conclusion.) 

> No, your argument is not correct because you hop to the next universe at each induction step. This makes it impossible to get a single expression that works for each $$n:\mathbb{N}$$ so you can't apply the $$\Pi$$-introduction rule to get an element of type $$\prod_{n:\mathbb{N}} A(n)$$ in the end. To make your induction uniform, you need to fix an infinite sequence of increasing universes $$\mathcal{U}:\mathbb{N}\to\mathcal{V}$$ at the outset. However, this is a (mild) large universe hypothesis so you need to work in HoTT+$$\mathcal{U}_\omega$$ to make this work.
