Interesting post!! I mostly liked the third question, and has a feeling that the answer should be affirmative. More specifically, adding a single Cohen real should produce a model of ZFC admitting an uncountable poset with infinite dimension. The uncountable poset would be Todorcevic's Souslin tree which is obtained as a composition of a coherent system of injections $$\langle e_\alpha:\alpha\rightarrow\omega\mid \alpha<\omega_1\rangle$$ composed with the generic Cohen real. Use the fact that the forcing notion is countable to diagonalize against any finite collections of linear ordering (of any uncountable subset).
