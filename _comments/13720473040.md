Sounds like one of the traditional [methods of proof](http://school.maths.uwa.edu.au/~berwin/humour/invalid.proofs.html) to me: it would just be too weird to be otherwise. (-: 

This may be one of the places where internal and external reasoning have to be distinguished. It may be the case that there is only one term we can write down in type theory which inhabits that type -- that seems like a plausible sort of paramatricity result, although saying that is a long way from actually proving it. But that would be a meta-theoretic statement about type theory, very different from a claim _inside_ type theory that that type has only one inhabitant. The latter is definitely not provable, because type theory has models in classical mathematics where LEM holds and thus non-uniform objects exist. (See e.g. Exercise 6.9.)
