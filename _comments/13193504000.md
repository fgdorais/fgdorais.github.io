Right! The same argument works replacing "Santa exists" by $$\bot$$... 

I was thinking of a different argument (which I think is how the paradox is usually described): Since $$R \in R \lthen (R \notin R \land R \in R)$$ and $$R \notin R \lthen (R \notin R \land R \in R)$$, from $$R \in R \lor R \notin R$$ we conclude $$R \notin R \land R \in R$$. 

I guess the real difference is that Curry's version doesn't require negation (or $$\bot$$).
