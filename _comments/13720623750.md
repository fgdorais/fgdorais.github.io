I don't understand what you mean by saying that equality is not primitive. It's not an independent primitive concept, because it's just one instance of the general notion of inductive type (and the same could be said of disjunction, conjunction, etc). But it's not a user-defined concept either (as it is in Bishop's set theory); you don't define equality on _A_ in a separate step (any more than you define _A_ \+ _A_ or other inductive types derivable from _A_).
