If you are using universes a la Tarski, then the $$\Pi$$-rules are set once and for all, but when you introduce a universe (or a family of them) you need to provide encoding for the $$\Pi$$ operator, and that is where the extra work comes in (but it is to be expected). 

Do we really need a separate judgment for universes? A universe is a structure $$(\mathcal{U}, \tau, \pi, \sigma, \ldots)$$ where $$\mathcal{U}$$ is a type, $$\tau$$ is a type family indexed by $$\mathcal{U}$$ (the map from codes in $$\mathcal{U}$$ to types), $$\pi$$ and $$\sigma$$ compute codes of dependent products and dependent sums, etc. Then there are equations explaining what $$\tau$$ does to $$\pi$$ and $$\sigma$$. If we make these propositional, we can pack everything up in a structure and talk about it inside type theory.
