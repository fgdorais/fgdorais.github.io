My favorite is Version 1. My main problem is that it was harder to write since I wanted to minimize the effect of the paths. I also hated wasting valuable letters to name these paths. This is probably just me, but it was hard to resist computing the paths in my head as I was composing the proof. Summary: this is fantastic for reading, but not for writing. 

Currently, Version 0 and Version 2 are tied for second place. The basic arguments are identical, so there is no distinction there. Version 2 does correct the error of Version 0, but it introduces a new one. In the end, writing $$(x,y)\cdot(y,x) =_{R^\times} (\mathsf{I},\mathsf{I})$$ is technically incorrect. The operation $$\square\cdot\square$$ is on $$R^\times$$, not on $$R \times R$$. One could argue that the same error is in Version 0, but there $$(x,y)$$ abbreviates $$(x,y,p):R^\times$$, so this usage is consistent with the local conventions. The other drawback of Version 2 is that the group operations are defined by specifying each individual value, I prefer the expressions in Version 0.
