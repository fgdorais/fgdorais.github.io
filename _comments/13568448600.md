Just to make things clear. I think both your comment and my response can be read as "passive agressive." Whoever reaches that conclusion should read again since that is not my intent nor is it Todd's intent (I believe). We're both extremely reasonable people who happen to be talking about a touchy subject using a language and medium that is unfortunately not a perfect reflection of our thoughts.
