For those comparing this with classic reverse math literature, they would have talked about the range of a function instead of an enumerable set in the sense given here (mostly to camouflage the terminology $$\Sigma^0_1$$). Thus the classic "Every function has a range" would translate to "Every enumerable set is decidable". The terminology "decidable set" is also nice because it brings out the relationship with constructive systems, where "set" does not mean "decidable set".
