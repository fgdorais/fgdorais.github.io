I don't agree that the point of informal type theory is to embed the calculus of judgments into common language. If that were all there was to it, then we could just describe all the judgments in words instead of symbols. I would say that the point is to modify the _usual_ mathematical language so that it becomes formalizable in type theory rather than set theory, hopefully requiring mathematicians to change their ways of thinking and writing as little as possible. I would really rather that they not have to constantly think in terms of judgments at all, let alone explaining why the premises of a judgment rule are satisfied. 

I remain to be convinced that there are any examples of "non-uniformity" that aren't obviously wrong on other grounds. We already know that typical ambiguity is something we have to be careful with (this comes up in chapter 10, for instance), and in that case the answer is simple: typical ambiguity just means neglecting to write the universe indices, so if your argument is no longer valid when you put the indices back in, it's wrong. So that example doesn't convince me of the need to muddy the waters by introducing a new term of art "uniformity".
