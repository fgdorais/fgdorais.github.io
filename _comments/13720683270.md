Ah, a good point about chapter 3. I'll fix that; thanks! 

And I do see what you mean about universes. Ultimately I think we wanted to say the simplest possible correct thing so that we could immediately start ignoring it. (-: Perhaps it would be appropriate to mention in the Notes to chapter 1, though, that a fixed ascending sequence of universes is not the only possible choice. (In fact, even in implementations it may not be the universal choice -- I think Coq's universe handling, and maybe even Agda's, actually does operate on the system of max/successor rather than indexing by natural numbers.)
