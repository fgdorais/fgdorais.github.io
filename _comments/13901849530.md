That was poor wording on my part. What I meant is that a type family needs to have a domain ($$\mathcal{U}$$) and a codomain. The codomain is what I meant by "living somewhere." The super universe approach (basically having a type $$\mathsf{Type}$$ without the problematic $$\mathsf{Type}:\mathsf{Type}$$) is one way around that. 

I suppose one can also have "free" type families but I think that requires a more elaborate formal framework. I don't think I ever looked at a formal development that has these. Are you aware of such a thing? I would love to have a look.
