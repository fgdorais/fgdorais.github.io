Thank you, Erin! I plan to add a few more thoughts about the multiverse when I find time to think about it more. Stay tuned! 

In general, an universe does not need to be a $$V_\alpha$$ or a transitive set in a larger compatible universe $$V$$. Any model of ZFC in $$V$$ is a compatible universe with the same standard system (from the divine point of view), if there is one such model then there is also a nonstandard model $$U$$ which is not wellfounded (from the point of view of $$V$$) and hence is not isomorphic to a transitive set in $$V$$.
