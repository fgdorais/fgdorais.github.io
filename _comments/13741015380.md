Version 1 really gives the flavour of fully proof-relevant mathematics, albeit at the cost of ultimately irrelevant verbiage. I wonder if you might rewrite ‘A slightly longer argument shows that this works even without the commutativity assumption.’ as ‘A slightly longer construction of q shows that this works even without the commutativity assumption.’ in that version. (That sentence was also left out of Version 3, I assume accidentally.)
