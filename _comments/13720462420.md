A nice post! Of course, I'm most curious to hear more about your quibbles, in the interests of improving future versions of the book. Can you say any more about why you think our uses of "set theory" should instead be "classical mathematics"? I just searched through the introduction for the phrase "set theory" and I couldn't find any instances which I could imagine replacing with "classical mathematics". 

Also, can you explain what it is you don't like about our universes? We did spend a while discussing how to treat universes, and the current choice is a compromise between competing goals. So there's certainly lots to dislike about it, but I'd like to hear if you have any specific suggestions.
