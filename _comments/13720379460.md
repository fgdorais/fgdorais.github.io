Oh, hmm... I don't think that's *quite* the issue with non-sets carrying group operations; let me call your $$\operatorname{lrid}$$ instead $$\operatorname{lrid}_G$$; what you've got there, then is a term in $$\prod_G \operatorname{lrid} $$; and it really ought to be the only term in $$\operatorname{lrid}_G$$, because if you had another one, then you'd have a canonical name for an element in $$\prod_G \prod_{e:G} e =_G e $$ that somehow didn't converge to reflectivity, using just the maps structure $$G \to G \to G$$, which is just too weird. 

I think what you've got a hold on there is that the other parts of the group structure can give you weird things; for instance, assuming $$\operatorname{lid}$$ and $$\operatorname{rid}$$ of the same does potentially give you an unknown identification $$e = e$$, but the solution to that is to actually assume left and right identity elements *separately*, and then use the canonical identification you've constructed here to treat them as the same. (compare the (Joyal) definition of "equivalence" you quoted in the previous post, where the section and retraction are supposed separately, and then a canonical homotopy is found between them). 

Much more difficult is associativity: as soon as there are 2-spheres floating around, one has room to distinguish $$A_3$$ and $$A_{4+n}$$; but everything not too wild that a classical mathematician would call a _group_ is equivalent to some loopspace, and indeed "loopspace" is probably the correct way to say "group" in HoTT. The difficult part in generalizing the equations-and-more-equations definition, as with formalizing $$\Delta$$-sets, is in writing down all the necessary coherences.
