Harvey Friedman made some interesting [remarks on FOM](http://cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/1997-November/000143.html) regarding the possibility of incorporating the structural and material views of sets in the foundations. Though he admits that this is possible and perhaps desirable, he claims that material set theory is the simplest foundationally complete system and he concludes that such efforts are not worthwhile. I don't fully disagree Friedman's claim but I do disagree with his conclusion. I think that there is a possibility for a sufficiently simple integration of material and structural perspective. I think that through the exploitation of the advantages of the material and structural views, we can achieve a foundation where the axioms are simpler and more natural at the expense of making the language a little more complex.
