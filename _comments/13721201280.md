That might be an ambiguity in formulation. My reading is that the sequence 
^
$$\mathcal{U}_0:\mathcal{U}_1:\cdots$$
^
 are the _only_ universes. Assuming my reading is incorrect and there may be other universes, I still get the impression that this fundamental sequence is cofinal. It would be good to clarify this. 

(Not important, but still, there is a philosophical issue with what those indices actually are.)
