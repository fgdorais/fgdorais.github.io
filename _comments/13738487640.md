In the definition of units, I chose to use right inverses instead of left inverses. This makes no difference since the ring is commutative. In fact, this makes no difference even if the ring is not commutative. If we use the left inverse definition 
^
$$\operatorname{\mathsf{unit}}'(y) :\equiv \sum_{x:R} (x \cdot y =_R \mathsf{I}),$$
^
 we realize that the group of units $$\set{y : R \mid \operatorname{\mathsf{unit}}'(y)}$$ is actually the exact same as the one above: they both equal 
^
$$\sum_{x,y:R} (x \cdot y =_R \mathsf{I})$$

 by univalence! The proof that this is a group is actually the same seen from the left or from the right. (Note that the verification that left and right inverses are the same is the main content of the definition of the group inverse.) 

I guess there is a side lesson here: univalence applies to proofs too! In HoTT, what we used to call "symmetric arguments" are actually the exactly the same...
