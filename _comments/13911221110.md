Another possibility to consider is inductive-recursive universes; are you familiar with those? Inductive-recursive definitions allow you to construct a new "universe" inside a given one, containing any specified collection of types and closed under any desired type forming operations, and with judgmental Tarski conversion. And if you allow a naive sort of "higher inductive-recursive definition", then such a universe can also be univalent (as long as the containing universe is already univalent). 

However, we don't yet know even whether ordinary inductive-recursive definitions are consistent with the homotopy interpretation, let alone "higher" ones.
