Like Assaf I am also most interested in the third question. I'm having a hard time grokking this dimension idea though. 

Do you mind giving more detail as to why "$$\aleph_0 \rightarrow (\aleph_0)^2_2$$ means that every infinite poset has an infinite subposet of dimension at most 2." From there I should be able to start thinking about this problem.
