I think your parenthetical answered your own question: a proof using a universe "U_omega" would be "wrong" in the type theory of the book in the same sense that a proof using an inaccessible cardinal would be wrong if ZFC is the implicit foundation. We made a particular choice for what the type theory underlying the book would be, mainly just for definiteness; of course there are lots of potential variations.
