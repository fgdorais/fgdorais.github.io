I don't think quantitative vs qualitative or geometry vs topology are fair comparisons, but there are some similarities. One of the main aspects which is different is that these are foundational views, so there is no a priori. We can't really think of labels and such, where would they come from? 

I like the analogy with combinatorial species. As formulated by Joyal, these are essentially structural, but they represent very real objects and they wouldn't be nearly as interesting if they did not correspond to real objects. However, this is misleading since even those real objects are not as material as the sets in material set theory. It's easy to formulate basic structures structurally. That's where structural set theory is most useful: the materialization of our thoughts is a much closer rendition of our actual thoughts. When we think of a tree, it doesn't matter what the root or branches are actually made of, all that matters is how the root and branches behave with their immediate environment. That's the nature of structural sets!
