Alexandre Borovik wrote an [interesting commentary](http://micromath.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/women-in-the-violent-world-of-mathematics-6/) on this comic. Zach Weiner's choice of gender for the two protagonists is very interesting, and Alexandre Borovik immediately connected this strip to previous comments on [Women in mathematics](http://micromath.wordpress.com/2008/12/26/women-and-mathematics/). I strongly recommend reading these and other interesting posts at [Mathematics under the Microscope](http://micromath.wordpress.com/), a blog which has been known to make me think very deeply about sociological aspects of mathematics. 

Besides the main discussion, there are two things that I found very interesting, more precisely two choices of epithets. The first is the _violent_ world of mathematics which I find to be a very fitting description of the basest aspects of mathematics. The second is the adjective _caustic_ to describe the style of this strip. That word, or rather my mental image of an acid bath, made me react immediately but I again found the choice very fitting after the initial discomfort.
