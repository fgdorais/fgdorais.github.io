I worked through a bunch of this today. I'm pretty confident I have a normal form for equational proofs that gives the right thing. Details are a bit of a pain but they are much cleaner than I had anticipated. I'm typing a note about this but it won't be a blog post because of all the proof trees and such (and typing will be slow for the same reason). Stay tuned!
