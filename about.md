## About me...

I am Fran√ßois G. Dorais and this is my research site!

As you may have noticed from the topics here, I am a mathematician specializing in logic and foundations. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2007 from [Dartmouth College](http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/) under the supervision of [Marcia Groszek](http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~groszek/). After that, I spent my time at various postdocs. I spent a year at [Cornell University](http://www.math.cornell.edu/) working with [Justin Moore](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~justin/) and [Richard Shore](http://www.math.cornell.edu/~shore/). Then, I spent three years at the [University of Michigan](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/), where I worked with [Andreas Blass](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~ablass/), [Peter Krautzberger](http://boolesrings.org/krautzberger/), and [Carl Mummert](http://m6c.org/). After a year at [Appalachian State University](http://www.mathsci.appstate.edu/), where I was working with [Jeff Hirst](http://mathsci2.appstate.edu/~jlh/) and [Paul Shafer](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~matpsh/), I went back to [Dartmouth College]({% post_url 2015-08-25-even-closer-to-the-origin %}), where I worked with Marcia Groszek and Mingzhong Cai. Now I am at the [University of Vermont](http://www.uvm.edu/cems/mathstat)!
