## Welcome to Research Site

This is the place to find information on my research interests and related topics. The site contents are divided into three main sections:

[Papers]({{ "/papers/index.html" | relative_url }})
: There you will find my list of publications, with abstracts, bibliographic information, and links to full text articles.

[Posts]({{ "/archives/index.html" | relative_url }})
: There you will find a collection of notes and comments on research topics. These notes tend to be [informal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _archives/santa-exists.md %}) but often [technical]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _archives/super-hott.md %}). 

[News]({{ "/news/index.html" | relative_url }})
: There you will find short posts about events of interest, such as my [most recent move]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-08-25-even-closer-to-the-origin %}), [website updates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-02-moving-to-github %}) and, of course, some [humor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2012-03-24-bumper-sticker %})...

This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You can find more info about the site itself at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fgdorais/fgdorais.github.io).

Have fun reading!
